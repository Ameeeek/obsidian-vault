In daily life, we're used to measuring angles in degrees. The radian is another scale commonly used in video games and math. 

You can convert radians into degrees by multiplying them by 180 and dividing them by PI: 

$$degrees = radians * 180 / \pi$$

An angle of PI radians corresponds to 180 degrees. And 2 * Pi is a full turn: 360 Degrees.

## How do Radians work exactly? 
Radians are a way to measure angles based on the radius of a circle. To get the angle in radians, you take the circle's radius and wrap it around the circle. That angle 1 radian because you are wrapping the radius 1 time around the circle

Because the perimeter of a circle is 2 * pi * Radius, a full turn (360) corresponds to 2 * pi radians: you need to wrap the radius of a circle 2 * PI times around the circle to make a full circle

# Better Pixel Art Color With Hue Shifting

### Hue Shifting
as the name implies, if your currently shading you want to make your drawing looks more alive with shifting the hues, so the basic idea is, the closer the color to the light source it looks more yellow or the slider goes to the right, and the further the color to the light source it looks more blue or the slider goes to the left

when shifting the values, you need to also look at the saturation and value, giving your color more saturation it'll make it more fun and happy and giving it more serious tone and dramatic by doing it the other way, the basic principles basically applies the same for value, so decides the vibes of your drawing first.  

HSV
Hue  : the base color in the color wheel 
Saturation : how vibrant the color is, the less saturation it looks more grey, the more saturation it looks more vibrant
Value : Brightness of the color

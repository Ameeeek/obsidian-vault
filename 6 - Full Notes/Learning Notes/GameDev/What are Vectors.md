scale variable has two variables to it: x and y. 

This is because scale is a Vector2, which stands for two-dimensional vector. A Vector2 represents 2D Coordinates. 

# What are vectors? 
A vector, in physics, is a quantity with a magnitude and a direction. For example, a force applied to some object, the velocity (speed and direction) of a character, and so on. 

We often represent this quantity with an arrow. 

In Godot, 2D Vectors are a common value type named Vector2, unlike plain numbers, they store two decimal numbers: one for the X coordinate and one for the Y coordinate.
